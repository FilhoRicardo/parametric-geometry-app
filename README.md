# Features 🌟
Intuitive Design Controls: Adjust sliders for the building's footprint, floor height, and the number of floors. Witness your design evolve in real-time!
Dynamic 3D Rendering: No more waiting! See your building come alive in 3D as you make changes.
Honeybee Integration: Advanced users can harness the potential of Honeybee models for more in-depth analysis and modeling.
# How it Works 🛠️
User Input: Define your building parameters through an intuitive interface.
Building Generation: Our algorithms craft a 3D model based on your inputs.
3D Visualization: Visualize your design in rich 3D, powered by VTK.
